# Project Title
A Python-based Logistic regression model to improve credit card fraud detection using a machine learning algorithm with reserach paper.

# Description
The major aim of this project is to build a credit card fraud detection model, which tells if the transactions made by a credit card are legitimate or fraudulent. 
Therefore, it is basically based on transaction and their labels as fraud or non-fraud detection process if the new transaction made by the customer is fraud or not. 
Additionally, the project will use the Logistic regression model and existing data and perform analyzing, visualizing, and splitting actions into data. 
And after this process will apply the Logistic regression model algorithm using python will recognize the fraudulent credit cards.

# Details
 This project will be based on a python machine learning algorithm by Logistic regression model. 
 It will depend on the data sets provided that will be provided as secondary data sets. 
 This research will investigate or recognize normal and fraudulent transactions. 
 Moreover, this project will use a Python-based algorithm that will use Anaconda API and the Jypter platform. 
 These will include some results such as showing normal and fraudulent transactions, how many transactions will be fraudulent or legitimate, 
 how many transactions will be done etc. This will help to show accurate results as well as conclude the whole methodology. 
 To perform these tasks will use SPSS and Matplotlib tools as it is easy to use and show perfect tables and graphs.
